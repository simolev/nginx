#       # For environment-specific secrets, you'd define them in the environment
#       # and they'd be implicitly available when `environment:` is set on the job.
#       # However, if you *must* pass a secret from the caller, you'd do:
#       # deploy_token: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DEPLOY_TOKEN }} # (assuming a repo secret name)
#       # OR, if you use a consistent secret name in the environment,
#       # and the reusable workflow's job uses `environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}`,
#       # the secret will be picked up automatically from that environment's secrets.
#       # The `secrets: inherit` is often the simplest for consistent naming.
#       inherit: secrets # This passes all secrets from the caller to the reusable workflow
